# RADV for Samsung Xclipse

A port of Mesa's RADV Vulkan driver to Samsung Xclipse GPUs on Android, based on Mesa
26.3.0-devel. Currently only the Xclipse 920 (Exynos 2200) and the Xclipse 530 (Exynos 1480) are
supported.

## Requirements

Tools:

| Tool | Version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Android NDK | r29 tested | the API 34 aarch64 compiler and `llvm-strip` |
| Meson | 1.4.0 or newer | |
| Ninja | any recent | |
| Python | 3.10 or newer | with `mako` (0.8.0 or newer) and `packaging` |
| glslangValidator | 12.2 or newer | from the Vulkan SDK or your distribution |

```sh
pip install mako packaging
```

Dependencies are fetched by Meson on the first configure, so that step needs network access:

| Library | Version | Use |
|---|---|---|
| libdrm | 2.4.133 | linked statically, with `subprojects/packagefiles/libdrm-xclipse-mmr-cache.patch` |
| zlib | 1.3.1 | linked statically |
| Expat | 2.5.0 | required by the configure step, not linked into the driver |

No Android platform libraries are needed: the build uses Mesa's Android stubs.

## Building

```sh
./build.sh /path/to/android-ndk      # Linux, macOS
build.cmd C:\path\to\android-ndk     # Windows
```

The NDK path can also come from `ANDROID_NDK_HOME` or `ANDROID_NDK_ROOT`. The build goes to
`build-android/` (set `BUILD_DIR` to change it). The script builds the driver, strips it, and
writes a package to `dist/`: a zip with `meta.json`, `vulkan.radeon.so` and `NOTICE.txt`, for
emulators that load custom Vulkan drivers from a zip.

## Compatibility

The driver works on the Xclipse 920 and the Xclipse 530. Other Xclipse models are not compatible
for now.

The Xclipse 940 (Exynos 2400, Galaxy S24) is in bring-up: it runs with the Xclipse 530's register
map, which the S24 kernel headers show it shares, but rendering is untested. The same lines go to logcat
(`adb logcat -s RADV_XCLIPSE_ID`) and to `radv_xclipse_id.txt` in the app's
`Android/data/<package>/files`, which survives a busy logcat.

## Runtime switches

Each switch is an environment variable or, for apps that cannot set one, an Android property.

| Property | Environment | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `debug.radv_xclipse_log` | `RADV_XCLIPSE_LOG` | `1` logs diagnostic markers to logcat, `2` adds the verbose trace |
| `debug.radv_xclipse_perf` | `RADV_XCLIPSE_PERF` | `1` logs whether the GPU or the app's CPU limits frame time |
| `debug.radv_xclipse_no_bc_emu` | `RADV_XCLIPSE_NO_BC_EMU` | `1` hides BC4-BC7 (no GPU decode at upload) |
| `debug.radv_xclipse_uf` | `RADV_XCLIPSE_UF` | `1` restores the user fence on graphics submits |
| `debug.radv_xclipse_mtype` | `RADV_XCLIPSE_MTYPE` | VA map MTYPE: `0` default, `3` upstream |
| `debug.radv_xclipse_pal_heaps` | `RADV_XCLIPSE_PAL_HEAPS` | `0` restores the single memory heap |
| `debug.radv_xclipse_dcc` | `RADV_XCLIPSE_DCC` | `0` turns off render target compression (DCC) |
| `debug.radv_xclipse_dcc_small` | `RADV_XCLIPSE_DCC_SMALL` | `0` turns off DCC for render targets of 512x512 and smaller only |
| `debug.radv_xclipse_fillclear` | | `1` clears a whole render target that has no compression by filling its memory instead of drawing (experimental) |
| `debug.radv_xclipse_bc5_alias` | `RADV_XCLIPSE_BC5_ALIAS` | `0` stores BC5 textures separately from their converted (EAC) copy again: twice the memory and a slower upload, but copying such a texture back out as BC5 returns the original data |
| `debug.radv_xclipse_titan` | `RADV_XCLIPSE_TITAN` | Xclipse 530 and 940: `0` stops remapping registers to their layout; lower levels than the default `10` remap only part of it |
| `debug.radv_xclipse_occ` | `RADV_XCLIPSE_OCC` | Occlusion queries: `0` counts with the GFX11 pixel-pipe events (default except on the 940), `1` with GFX10.3 ZPASS_DONE, `2` does not count and reports every query as visible (default on the 940, where `0` hangs the GPU) |
| `debug.radv_xclipse_waitbypass` | `RADV_XCLIPSE_WAITBYPASS` | `1` makes the command processor read fences from memory instead of the GPU's L2 cache when it waits on them (default on the 940 only) |
| `debug.radv_xclipse_eopl2` | `RADV_XCLIPSE_EOPL2` | `1` writes end-of-pipe fences through the L2 cache (experimental, off by default) |
| `debug.radv_xclipse_pace` | `RADV_XCLIPSE_PACE` | Xclipse 920 only: `0` stops holding back the app's GPU work when it runs uncapped (vsync off), which otherwise keeps the Android UI responsive; `2` holds it back even for short jobs |
| `debug.mesa_xclipse_prof` | `MESA_XCLIPSE_PROF` | `<delay>,<seconds>` profiles CPU and GPU time per frame and per render pass, then writes `mesa_prof_<pid>.txt` to `MESA_XCLIPSE_PROF_DIR` or the app's `Android/data/<package>/files`. `t,<seconds>` instead profiles `<seconds>` each time `debug.mesa_xclipse_prof_go` changes (`t,<seconds>,g` without CPU sampling), writes to `debug.mesa_xclipse_prof_dir` if set, and also prints the summary to logcat (tag `XPROF`) |

## Disclaimer

This project was developed with heavy use of AI tools. Every change is built and tested on a
Galaxy S22 Ultra (SM-S908B, Xclipse 920) and a Galaxy A55 (SM-A556B, Xclipse 530) before it is
published.

has the full texts. The notices for everything compiled into the driver ship in the package as
`NOTICE.txt`.
